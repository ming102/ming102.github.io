      <description>When I got up in the morning, I opened my computer. Inadvertently into Li Danyuan&amp;rsquo;s QQ space, in his album saw a photo of Guan Chengjun - much more handsome than before, the gods, a manly man!
It seems that I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen him for years, and I don&amp;rsquo;t know where he is now working in where he is developed, I don&amp;rsquo;t know anything about him now. As if the only remaining little friendship between classmates is also so difficult to touch.</description>

      <description>The cloud fell deeply in love with the sky from the day it saw it.
Cloud said that the sky was a myth in her heart and she could not resist the power of God.
So she said to the sky, &amp;ldquo;I love you! Love your brilliant blue!&amp;rdquo;
The sky smiles, &amp;ldquo;I belong to all things and cannot be attributed to your love.&amp;rdquo;
The sea is also deeply in love with clouds from the day it sees them.</description>
