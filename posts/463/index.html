    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>The cloud fell deeply in love with the sky from the day it saw it.</p>
<p>Cloud said that the sky was a myth in her heart and she could not resist the
power of God.</p>
<p>So she said to the sky, &ldquo;I love you! Love your brilliant blue!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sky smiles, &ldquo;I belong to all things and cannot be attributed to your
love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sea is also deeply in love with clouds from the day it sees them.</p>
<p>Because the love in his heart is as white as the clouds.</p>
<p>But he loved in his heart because he knew that Cloud had fallen in love with
Sky.</p>
<p>Perhaps God destined him to be a latecomer.</p>
<p>The clouds are listed in the love of the sky</p>
<p>The sky is always smiling at her from afar.</p>
<p>Not too far and not too close.</p>
<p>Is the breadth of the sky unable to accommodate an admiring love?</p>
<p>Cloud cries secretly.</p>
<p>Bitter love, bitter love &hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>The sea is aching in the heart.</p>
<p>What is intolerable is a crush crying.</p>
<p>The sea vows, &ldquo;I will want to be like the blue sky and then nestle my clouds!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the sea is changing itself.</p>
<p>He shall be wide, spreading over seven tenths of the surface of the earth.</p>
<p>He wants azure, accepting the show of rivers and lakes &hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>Even so, the sea can not change the gap between him and the sky, the</p>
<p>The sea is always so small &hellip;&hellip;</p>
<p>Heaven is still looking up at the world in the realm of nothingness.</p>
<p>Condescendingly indifferent to the presence of clouds.</p>
<p>The clouds cry secretly at the edge of love and pain.</p>
<p>The white clouds have become ominous clouds.</p>
<p>The rain of sadness is dripping, it is bitter tears.</p>
<p>Her tears fell into the heart of the sea and</p>
<p>Stirring up the angry waves of the sea.</p>
<p>He pounded hard on the scorched stones of the shore.</p>
<p>Then the breath of buried love is knocked into broken froth.</p>
<p>The cloud could not stop the flow of tears for three days and nights,</p>
<p>The sea also used his heart for three days and nights,</p>
<p>The sea has become salty</p>
<p>Those are the tears of the clouds filling the sea of suffering</p>
<p>The clouds know that, from a distance</p>
<p>There is a sea watching her,</p>
<p>But she didn&rsquo;t look back at the person watching her.</p>
<p>A heart can only hold one myth.</p>
<p>Finally, one day, the</p>
<p>The sea says to the clouds, &ldquo;I love you! I always look up to you with love!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cloud&rsquo;s melancholy eyes shone with pain and</p>
<p>She will not turn her back on her faith in love.</p>
<p>And then to chase another unthought of love!</p>
<p>The clouds did not respond to the sound of the sea</p>
<p>In love and unlove.</p>
<p>She chose to run away.</p>
<p>Thus.</p>
<p>Right in the middle of the sky and the sea.</p>
<p>Clouds learn to drift.</p>
<p>The sky does not belong to the clouds, and the clouds do not belong to the
sea!</p>
<p>This is the end:</p>
<p>The clouds did not throw themselves into the arms of the sky,</p>
<p>The sea is not touched by the clouds either.</p>
<p>From then on, the sea looked up to the clouds, and the clouds looked up to the
sky.</p>
<p>The cloud floats between two hearts,</p>
<p>I can no longer find the sky I flew in</p>
<p>and the sea that can be used as a dressing mirror &hellip;&hellip;</p>
